title = "About Me"

+++

My journey in technology started in 1999 when my father opened a computer store in my hometown out in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia.

It did not take long for me to discover my affinity for technology. I built my first computer at age 12 with a blistering Pentium III and whopping 256mb of memory. During my teen years, I found myself building websites, albeit cPanel and an early iteration of Joomla. Then, in my senior year, I discovered Linux and discovered my true passion for system administration and networking.

Fast forward a few years, and I find myself immersed in the world of DevOps, Lean IT and Ops-as-a-Product. I currently work at Envato as a Site Reliability Engineer but also spend a reasonable amount of time wearing my Platform Engineer hat.

My other lifelong passion is music. I started with classical piano as a child and moved onto guitar and then singing during my high school years. If I’m not in the cloud automating development operations, I can generally be found writing, producing and performing music. Mostly in the form of blues/folk/pop.

Lastly, I guess worth mentioning is my service as a volunteer firefighter for the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. I’m the third generation of RFS in my family, with both my father and his father serving in leading roles across the state. My training in emergency response and high-stress situations comes in handy in almost all areas.

Well, that is enough for now. Time to get back to work!
